## About
REAMDE is a Hack Club [You-Ship-We-Ship](https://ysws.hackclub.com/) about making your Github profile a little more interesting. <br>
```
A Github README explains what your project is and how to use it. 
Profile README’s are special README’s that appear on your profile.
To create a profile README, simply create a new repository with your username with a README.MD.

E.G., idksarah/idksarah ← is my special repo.
View it at github.com/idksarah/idksarah.
See it in action at github.com/idksarah.
```
## How?
For your script, use any language you like--eg. javascript or python. <br>
To automate your profile's updates, I suggest setting up [Github Actins](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). <br>
You'll also have to track your time using [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/)<br>
Last thing you need is a README.md. Include the name of your project, a description, a usage guide, and images.<br>
## Submission Requirements
- Display/use data from an API
- Automatically update your profile at least every 24 hours
- Track at least 3 hours building on Hackatime

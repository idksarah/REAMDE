## About
REAMDE is a Hack Club [You-Ship-We-Ship](https://ysws.hackclub.com/) about making your Github profile a little more interesting. <br>
```
A Github README.md is a markdown file located in a project repository that explains what your project is and how to use it. 
Profile README’s are special README’s that appear on your profile.
To create a profile README, simply create a new repository with your username with a README.MD.

E.G., idksarah/idksarah ← is my special repo.
View it at github.com/idksarah/idksarah.
See it in action at github.com/idksarah.
```
After completion, receive an [Octocat](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/collectibles/products/1539555-00-invertocat-pin) or [Copilot](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/collectibles/products/1550348-00-copilot-pin) pin.
## Requirements
- Your project must display data from an API
- Your project must automatically update your profile at least every 24 hours
- You must track at least 2 hours building on Hackatime
- You must open source your code on Github
- Submission must be meaningful
## How?
For your script, use any language you like—eg. Javascript or Python. <br>
To automate your profile updates, I suggest setting up [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). <br>
You'll also have to track your time using [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/).<br>
Last thing you need is a README.md. Include the name of your project, a description, a usage guide, and images.<br>
## Project Ideas
- Art from your Github activity using [Octokit JS](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js/)
- A weather display using a [weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) 
- An ISS tracker using [the ISS's official telemetry](https://www.telemetry.space/)
- A movie display using a [movie API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)
